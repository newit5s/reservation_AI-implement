[2025-11-06] Cypress run failed: Error: spawn Xvfb ENOENT - missing Xvfb dependency for headless execution.
[2025-11-07] Replaced the Cypress entrypoint with a Node-based runner that transpiles TypeScript tests using esbuild, removing the
           Xvfb dependency. `npm run test:e2e` now executes without requiring any system-level display server.
